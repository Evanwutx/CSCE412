          <h2>Plagiarism Detector</h2>
          <p class = "mainParagraph">
            In high school for a science fair I created a plagiarism detector using a <a href="https://monkeylearn.com/blog/what-is-tf-idf/">TF-IDF algorithm.</a> TF-IDF stands for term frequency-inverse document
            frequency. The algorithm works by assigning weights to each word, the higher frequency of a word across multiple different documents, the less
            weight it begins to have. This is to prevent common words like: "the", "and", etc which are seen across all documents from impacting the plagiarism detection. On the other hand words
            that appear a lot but only in a few documents are weighted higher and these are the words that are looked at when comparing different documents for plagiarism. Because 
            this method is more effective when the data set is large, the plagiarism detector was intended for mass comparison of documents like in schools with many
            different students turning in an essay as opposed to just comparing two different documents. Additionally I added a component to call a database to look for synonyms of the words
            to account for common occurrences of switching out words with synonyms.

          <h2>Social Media Stock Picker and Analyzer</h2>
          <p class= "mainParagraph">
            One of the projects that I plan on working on is a stock picker application that scans various financial social media personalities and communities
            then looks for the stocks they recommend. The application will look for stocks and the words associated with it. If the words are positive then the stock is marked as a potential buy and vice versa if the
            words are negative. From this data gathered, I plan on creating different models with portfolios composed of these various stock picks. I also plan to have inverse
            portfolios to see the performance of stocks not recommended by these online personalities and communities. I then want to compare and analyze these different models against each other and also against the market average.
            Overall, I want to see how well these people and communities understand the stock market and if they can beat it. This idea was inspired by a video from Michael Reeves.
