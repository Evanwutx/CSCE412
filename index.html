          <p class = "mainParagraph">
            Howdy! My name is Evan Wu and I'm currently a Junior Computer Engineering student at Texas A&M university.
            I love learning about all things related to computers both hardware and software and enjoy problem solving and 
            building solutions. My interest in computers and technology started through my dad, who himself is a software engineer. From a
            young age, he was constantly introducing me to new concepts and ideas in the space and from middle school
            through high school I explored many different aspects of programming from web development to game design. With
            both this interest in computers along with a love for problem solving, I knew that going into college this path 
            was for me. Now, my interests revolve around data science, I enjoy building data-heavy applications
            and I plan on pursuing a Master's degree in the field.
          </p>
          <p class= "mainParagraph">
            Disregarding technology, I'm a person who loves nature and the outdoors. I enjoy hiking, rock climbing, and
            biking in my free time and have been to over 40 different national and state parks across the U.S. I also
            love traveling to other countries and enjoying the different environment, culture, and food that they have to offer.
            I'm a very outgoing person who enjoys working together with others. Feel free to connect with me through my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/evan-wu-7023b0226/">Linkedin</a> or
