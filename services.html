          <h2>Perot Museum Camp Volunteer</h2>
          <p class = "mainParagraph">
            I was a camp assistant volunteer for the <a href="https://www.perotmuseum.org/">Perot Museum of Nature and Science's</a> Discovery camp. This summer camp
            gave young children exposure to the world of Science and Engineering through fun educational activities. As a camp
            assistant, I assisted the instructor in teaching and supervising these young children as they learn all about different
            topics in science. I also worked in the halls of the main museum performing pocket science and further educating visitors.
            For the last week of the summer camp, the other volunteers and I came together to brainstorm ideas for a new exhibit. We then were
            able to pitch this idea to the directors of the museum to potentially add the exhibit to the actual museum.

          <h2>Keep America Beautiful Cleanup Volunteer</h2>
          <p class= "mainParagraph">
            I was a cleanup volunteer for <a href="https://kab.org/">Keep America Beautiful</a>, an organization focused on cleaning and maintaining communities around
            America. I participated in various cleanups around the Dallas Metro Area from local parks to clearing up areas near Highways. Besides just
            cleaning up trash from various green spaces, I also helped plant new trees and build new benches to beautify these spaces.
          </p>
          <h2>Habitat for Humanity</h2>
          <p class= "mainParagraph">
            I was a home building volunteer for <a href="https://www.habitat.org/volunteer">Habitat for Humanity</a>, an organization focused on building
            and maintaining safe affordable housing for local communities. I was apart of 3 different projects to build houses in low income neighborhoods.
            We were able to help 3 different families who normally would not be able to afford a home.
